			<div class ="post-content">
				<p> My friend and I visited my primary school in winter vacation and taught half of kids in the school how to code.</p>
				<p> Nevertheless We didn't get paid a dollar, I know for sure this experience would be one of the most meaningful and joyful time I've ever spent in my vacation. </p>

				<p>	 So this is how things happened. About 3 months ago, I saw an genious coding tutorial packed by AngryBird logic from <a href="http://code.org/">this website</a> on facebook, and I was totally into it even I was not a kid at all.</p> 
				<p>I was wondering, how do really kids like it? At the same time, I was accepted to join Life is Tech. In this context, the idea of teaching kids by tutorial provided by code.org came to me naturally and I contacted my teacher in the school right away.</p> 
				<p> As a result, as you can see from the photo at very top of this page. We did it. </p>

				<img class="grayscale" src="img/TK/TK09_filter.jpg" style="width:100%">
				<p> This experience was wonderful for me not just because I made it to introduce the tutorial, but also because that I tried in person something that I thought will be great to have, and of course, it was even greater than I thought. :)</p>
